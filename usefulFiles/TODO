SHALLOW: 
    - add filter
    - add 3 bars for categories
    - make the graph fit in somehow
    - make the progress-bar explode or be colored when something exceeds the boundary
    - add a gum-destroyer rating
    - spelling misakes
    - add GRAPH DATA TO JSON FILE
    - fix paths

DEEP: 
    - add a buying guide that matches a snus to a buyers desires
    - add all the data regarding every category in a big *.json for storage and so 
        that the whole fucking website does not have to be remade every fucking time
